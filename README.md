# InstantGram

A new age, minimalistic social media app to connect with your loved ones.


## Prerequisites (For using without Docker)
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Git (for clonning)
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm 
- PostGres
- Redis
## Installation

```bash
  cd ./client
  npm i
  npm run dev
```

Open new Terminal and run the following commands

```bash

Note: You Can also run the app with docker (I have added dockerfile and docker-compose.yml) but still you have to change many things in env. So I recommend to run without docker
